However, the lack of integration between the radiologist and CAD systems restrains the rate of progress as well as the reach of such advancements in clinical use. This article aims to improve the clinical efficiency of ultrasound based CAD systems for classification of breast lesions by integrating back-propagation artificial neural network (BPANN), support vector machine (SVM) and radiologist feedback. The acquired breast ultrasound images were subjected to wavelet based filtering in order to reduce speckle noise followed by feature extraction, feature selection and classification. Experiments on a database of 178 ultrasound images of breast anomalies (88 benign and 90 malignant) show that the proposed methodology achieves classification accuracy of 98.621% and 98.276%, respectively, when all 457 and 19 most relevant features selected by multi-criteria feature selection method were used for classification. The accuracy achieved is significantly higher than that using conventional classifiers based on BPANN and SVM. Further, it is found that integrating expert opinion in CAD systems improves its overall performance. The quantitative results obtained are discussed in light of some recently reported studies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Breast tumor classification; Machine learning; Neural network; Radiologist opinion; Support vector machine; Ultrasound,Artificial intelligence; Backpropagation; Computer aided analysis; Computer aided diagnosis; Computer aided instruction; Diagnosis; Feature extraction; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Medical imaging; Neural networks; Support vector machines; Ultrasonic imaging; Ultrasonics; Wavelet analysis; Back propagation artificial neural network (BPANN); Breast tumor classifications; Breast ultrasound images; Computer aided diagnostics; Experimental investigations; Feature selection and classification; Feature selection methods; Radiologist opinion; Classification (of information),Elsevier Ltd,English,Expert Sys Appl,Article

It presents a technique for depth map estimation using stereoscopic images - a vital intermediate technique for autonomous navigation and pathfinding. It also proposes a path planner interfaced with the depth map for locally planning a sequence of steps to the desired location. A single RGB camera does not contain sufficient information to estimate depth with satisfactory accuracy. Depth cameras are significantly more expensive than RGB cameras, and hence would not be suited for projects requiring lower budget constraints. Hence a middle ground is required which requires depth calculation from limited available input. Depth estimation is accomplished with a convolutional neural network trained on synthetic randomly generated stereo image data. The path planner comprises a short-term path planner for obstacle avoidance, and a long-term path planner for approaching the destination coordinates. The results show that this approach yields a factor of approximately 1.8 times the steps of human performance on the same task. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",Artificial Intelligence; Autonomous agents; Computer vision; Convolutional Neural Network; Depth map; Neural Network; Path finding; Simulation; Stereo images,Air navigation; Artificial intelligence; Budget control; Cameras; Computer vision; Convolution; Neural networks; Robotics; Robots; Stereo image processing; Stereo vision; Convolutional neural network; Depth Map; Path finding; Simulation; Stereo-image; Autonomous agents,Association for Computing Machinery,English,ACM Int.

Agriculture has to tackle many problems like changing climate, water shortage, changing soil quality, etc. Due to the increasing demand for cereals and other crops for daily usage by the consumers there is a need for smarter implementation of irrigation and also develop farming methods that alter the basic eco systems and is less harmful to other creatures. India is one of highest crop producing countries all over the world. At the same time, India is facing the challenge of farmers committing suicide because of crop failure and debt. Most of the land in India is still being used for agriculture purposes. Still there exists several places that uses very primitive methods for irrigation, fertilization etc. This leads to the reduction in the crop yield and eventually less income for the farmers. This paper discusses the design and development of an IoT framework that helps farmers to improvise their methods of farming and also make the best use of their land for a better yield and income. The major goal of this IoT framework is to sense agriculture characteristics and advice farmers to properly grow and treat the crops. The system deploys a group of wireless sensor networks nodes deployed in the field for sensing agricultural parameters and the RF communication of WSN node is used to transmit the measured data to base station. Base station is connected to a decision support system. Based on the sensed parameters and the optimum values, the decision support system will generate an appropriate message for farmers. By using the collected data from the sensors, the proposed system will provide suggestions about the monitoring crop such as irrigation timings, directions for optimum usage of fertilizers etc. in accordance to the farmers' lands. An android application has been designed to deliver the messages to farmers in their regional language. The android app also gives information regarding the weather forecast and precaution to be taken based on the weather forecast. © 2017 IEEE.",Agriculture; Automation; IoT; Precision Farming; Smart Irrigation; Wireless Sensor Networks,Agriculture; Android (operating system); Artificial intelligence; Automation; Base stations; Crops; Decision support systems; Internet of things; Irrigation; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Android applications; Changing climate; Design and Development; Iot frameworks; Optimum value; Precision farming; RF communication; Water shortages; Weather forecasting,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,English,"GHTC - IEEE Glob.

Initially, named entities have been identified from the extracted crime corpus and certain pair of entities have been chosen that facilitates the crime analysis. Then the entity pairs with their intermediate context words have been represented as a shallow parse tree for relation instance. From the parse trees, only the head words (in each entity pair) reflecting the main meaning of the phrases has been considered for measuring a semantic similarity using a web search engine that retrieves the page count of those particular words and their conjunctives. The derived page count is used for measuring the Simpson Coefficient between the pairs and based on this similarity score, an agglomerative hierarchical clustering technique has been applied that makes several clusters of entity pairs of same relationship. The resultant clusters also have been characterised with the most frequent head word present in the group. This proposed method shows a simple similarity measure technique for relation extraction from crime data providing better accuracy than other existing methods. © 2017 IEEE.",hierarchical clustering; page count; semantic similarity; Web search engine,Artificial intelligence; Crime; Information retrieval; Natural language processing systems; Search engines; Semantics; Websites; Agglomerative hierarchical clustering; Hier-archical clustering; Page counts; Relation extraction; Semantic similarity; Semantic similarity measurement; Similarity measure; Unsupervised approaches; Semantic Web,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

The proper sub bands for segmentation are selected depending on the HVS. The HVS imitates the original visual technique of a human being and it is used to divide each sub band into Weber, De-Vries Rose and Saturation regions. A sub band is selected for segmentation depending on those three regions.

As, it can enhance lifetime of the sensor network by distributing load among the sensors. In some delay-critical applications, a mobile sink is allowed to move along a predefined path. However, due to the predefined path and relatively slower speed of mobile sink, data gathering from sensors may delayed. Thus, time-sensitive data collection in a constrained path environment using mobile sink has increased attention in the research community.

We replace least significant bits from enveloped image with the bits of original image at the time of LSB based image steganography. This approach is not as secured as retrieving the least significant bits from the enveloped image will provide all the information of original image. So in the proposed system, we rearrange all the pixels of the original and the enveloped image using prime and non-prime positions of the pixels. Again we reposition all the pixels using one of the user defined pixel repositioning algorithms (PRONE (positional reverse odd normal even), PRENO (positional reverse even normal odd), CRENO (continuous reverse even normal odd), CRONE (continuous reverse odd normal even)) chosen by the user for original and enveloped image separately. Lastly we perform user defined BWMAS operation (Bitwise Masking & Alternate Sequence) between the bits of original image and the least significant bits of the enveloped image. As all the pixels of both enveloped and original images are repositioned, so the pixels from original image are chosen actually in non sequential manner and the pixels, taken from enveloped image for BWMAS operation are also in non sequential manner. Only the proper sequences of the encrypted pixels defined by the user defined algorithms are being able to retrieve the information of the original image. We introduce Bitwise Masking & Alternate Sequence operation for the first time in state of XOR operation.

To select those genes which are relevant as well as with least redundancy among them, we use successive approaches like Filter methods and Normalization phase. In this work, after pre-processing of the data, we have used three types of spectral clustering methods, Unnormalized, Ng-Jordan and proposed entropy based Shi-Malik spectral clustering algorithms to find important genetic and biological information.

While in cryptography, the goal is to make everything unreadable to the ones who do not know the password, in steganography, on the other hand, the goal is to camouflage a message inside an apparently innocent carrier. In other words, while cryptography conceals the message itself, steganography conceals the existence of the message. Since, this form of communication potentially attracts unsavoury people to secretly hide messages in plain sight, there have been many efforts on different fronts to detect the possibility of the existence of steganography in images and other multimedia objects. Most of such algorithms use different statistical analysis based attacks for detecting potential cases of steganography.

So a hybrid cryptosystem is introduced here which is a combination of both asymmetric key and symmetric key cryptosystem. In the proposed technique, the encryption of the shared key is done using RSA algorithm by receiver's public key. Then the plain text is encrypted using the shared key to form the cipher text.

It is imperative to find out a best possible method for ECG Signal de-noising, which may be investigated by finding and comparing the signal-to-signal-plus-noise ratios (SSNR) and root-mean-square deviations (RMSD). By considering a mother wavelet with different levels and threshold, the values of SSNR and RMSD are calculated and compared to achieve a best possible result. Similarly, by utilizing different frame lengths and polynomial orders, the S-G filter is employed to find SSNR and RMSD. The results of these methods are also compared. Finally, the orders and frame lengths of S-G filters can be obtained by optimizing with the help of particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique. © 2017 IEEE.",ECG (Electrocardiogram); PSO (Particle swarm optimization); RMSD (Root mean square deviation); S-G (Savitzky-Golay) filter; SSNR (Signal-to-signal-plus-noise ratio); Wavelet,Artificial intelligence; Bandpass filters; Bioelectric phenomena; Conformations; Electrocardiography; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Phase equilibria; Signal analysis; Signal filtering and prediction; Tensors; Wavelet analysis; Noise ratio; PSO(particle swarm optimization); Root mean square deviations; Savitzky-Golay; Wavelet; Biomedical signal processing,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

The training samples are randomly chosen by means of bootstrap technique to train the different SVM independently. These SVM's are combined together to generate the ensemble SVM. The proposed method then makes a collective decision by aggregating them. It may be noted that, the performance of the practical SVM is far from the theoretical SVM as the implementations are based on approximated algorithms. The performance of the real SVM can be uplifted by using the proposed ensemble SVM with bagging (bootstrap aggregating).

To explore the relationships or the impacts of the causal factors on the accidents and to predict the incident outcomes i.e., injury, near miss, and property damage cases, Bayesian Network (BN) model is used in this paper. The proposed model is validated using the data retrieved from an integrated steel manufacturing industry in India using sensitivity analysis.

Using radar and other available technology, flights operating entirely over land can be tracked easily. However, with long haul intercontinental flights, where majority of the flight path is over water bodies and out of range of radar, detecting the location of aircraft at all times is a challenge. In recent times, there have been disasters in commercial aviation, where an aircraft has gone missing. This has a huge social and financial impact on the specific airline and commercial aviation in general. Therefore, in this paper we study the problem of location detection for commercial aircraft and methods to improve location detection over any terrain the flight path traverses. We propose techniques based on the Internet-of-things (IoT) model for aircraft, where the aircraft can communicate with each other within a certain range. We introduce distributed algorithms to detect location using such methods that work effectively when the aircraft is outside the range of radar and on an oceanic route.

For this reason the exact recognition of vessels become difficult. In order to overcome this difficulty and early detection of eye diseases there are various vessel segmentation techniques. This paper presents a Hybrid Neighbourhood Estimator before Filling (NEBF) with ACO which enables us to segment vessels even in low intensity of images. We Firstly extracted the exudates from fundus image then applying NEBF. NEBF is an inpainting filter which is used to inpaint exudates so that false positives are reduced in image. The ACO is applied based on segmentation. The proposed method is tested on DRIVE database.

The proposed work aims at classifying the pronation and supination movements of the forearm. The primary actuators of these movements are located in the forearm whereas upper arm muscles provide assistance. Instead of forearm muscles, upper arm muscles namely biceps brachii and triceps brachii are chosen for sEMG signal collection. This makes it suitable for the development of an arm orthosis even if the person has a below elbow amputation. Features extracted from the pre-processed sEMG are used as predictors for machine learning (ML) algorithms. Multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) and random forest (RF) are the machine learning algorithms addressed in this work. Each feature is used individually to train MLPNN to distinguish between pronation and supination. Two features namely IEMG (Integrated EMG) and SSC (Number of Slope Sign changes) were chosen as best predictors from experimentation. These two features were used together for prediction but the improvement was not satisfactory. Effects of using delayed inputs were studied, and it improved the classification by a considerable margin. RF model was then trained with the same predictor set, and it outperformed MLPNN.

In our earlier studies, acoustic analysis was carried out to characterize the infant cry signal due to different cause of crying. In this paper, we propose an Intelligent Cry Monitoring and Cry Detection System (ICMCDS) that can help working parents who are constrained to leave their children with the care-takers, and remain worried about their well-being. They need to be notified when their child cries. Functional prototype of a smart ICMCDS is developed at low-cost, which can monitor a child in real-time. Signal processing methods auto-correlation and a recently proposed modified zero-frequency filtering are used for cry-detection. Features F0, Strength of Excitation and Signal Energy are extracted from the cry signal. Parameters mean, standard deviation and normalized standard deviation in F0 are derived. Acoustic analysis of the cry signal helps detecting a cry as well as the cry-cause. The system detects a cry and informs the parent automatically through sms. If the child-cry continues for some time, then the intelligent system sends a second message, raising urgency concern. Further the system also identifies the likely cause of crying by examining the features, and informs to the parents by a third sms. The concerned parent may talk to a human controller, who in-turn can give control commands to a robot, using a webpage or mobile phone. The robot, equipped with audio-visual sensors, can be sent near to the child to get the actual state, by sending back live video streaming of the child and surroundings. It also validates the alert message about child crying. Wi-Fi medium is used for communication between humans and the robot. Performance evaluation is carried out using an Infant Cry Signals Database (IIITS ICSD 2). The proposed ICMCDS has a range of applications in homes, hospitals, child-care centers and schools. © 2017 IEEE.",Cry Detection Automated System; cry signal analysis; IIITS-ICSD 2; modZFF; signal energy; strength of excitation; Wi-Fi controlled remote operation,Artificial intelligence; Automation; Correlation methods; Intelligent systems; Robots; Signal analysis; Signal detection; Signal processing; Statistics; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Automated systems; IIITS-ICSD 2; modZFF; Remote operation; Signal energy; Correlation detectors,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,English,IEEE Reg 10 Annu Int Conf Proc TENCON,Conference Paper

A recommender system for niche application requires more accuracy as it targets a specific audience or a specific genre of products to recommend. Certain examples of niche domains include course recommendation for university courses, text recommendation for translators etc. In this paper, we address the problem of designing a recommender system for one such niche domain, a course recommender system. It generates recommendation of university courses for students based on the courses previously preferred by the student. Since such recommendations play a role similar to decision support systems for students, it is evident that it has to be relevant in predicting preferences. Also, every new choice made by the user unfolds additional information about a user which was previously unknown to the system. Literature suggests that course recommender systems have been developed mostly without the use of machine learning techniques. Treating student preference information as a general recommendation problem, it can be represented in a matrix format and generating a low-rank matrix representation have provided encouraging results. Inclusion of additional information in order to make more accurate predictions, leads to higher computational complexity and instability in learning parameters. To overcome such hurdles in designing a Course Recommender System, we propose a similarity based regularization for low-rank matrix factorization algorithm which learns the prediction matrix very fast and is stable. © 2017 IEEE.",Course Recommender System Recommender System; Low-rank matrix factorization; Online Matrix Completion,Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; E-learning; Factorization; Forecasting; Learning systems; Matrix algebra; Online systems; Students; Accurate prediction; Learning parameters; Low-rank matrices; Machine learning techniques; Niche applications; Online matrix; Preference information; University course; Recommender systems,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,English,IEEE Reg 10 Annu Int Conf Proc TENCON,Conference Paper

Our study covering 820 Primary Studies through 14 SLRs, shows that Software Effort Estimation studies focus more on statistical techniques and Machine Learning is taking precedence in comparison to the others; whereas Expert Judgement is preferred by the industry due to its intuitiveness. There is a need for models that are simple to understand and global, due to the distributed nature of software development. The studies are inconclusive about the accuracy benefits of using a within company dataset vs.external datasets. Machine learning techniques such FL and GA in combination with Analogy methods generate more accurate estimates.

We propose a novel approach of dissecting driver's conduct by using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) and a combination of Convolutional Neural Network with Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) that would give better results in less response time. We are likewise proposing to concentrate high level features and interpretable features depicting complex driving examples by trying CNN, RNN and then CNN with LSTM. We could improve the system accuracy to 95% by combining CNN with LSTM. © 2017 IEEE.",ADAS; Deep learning CNN; ITS; LSTM; RNN,Artificial intelligence; Automation; Automobile drivers; Convolution; Deep learning; Home health care; Intelligent buildings; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Internet of things; Learning systems; Neural networks; Recurrent neural networks; ADAS; Convolutional neural network; Daily life activities; Driver assistance system; High-level features; Internet of Things (IOT); LSTM; Recurrent neural network (RNN); Long short-term memory,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,English,"Int.

Thus, context aware recommender systems are used for providing recommendations. As recommender systems suffers from cold start, sparse data and scalability problems. Therefore, artificial neural networks (ANN) are used to solve these problems. But, training of ANN again takes a very large time, due to high dimensional features. Hence, feature subset selection is done to solve this problem. But, it is a kind of combinatorial optimization problem, which could be solved by using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). ACO with heuristic function as fuzzy values obtained after applying fuzzy c means clustering algorithm over movie lens data set provided optimum results. Back propagation algorithm has been used, for the training of neural network, only on those features which are obtained after applying modified ACO along with roulette wheel selection algorithm. Results are analyzed by providing ratings of those movies which are not provided in 'movie lens data set' yet, as a solution to cold start problem.

Specifically, it functions by the Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM), or hypervisor. The reconstructed semantic details obtained by the VMI are available in a combination of benign and malicious states at the hypervisor. In order to distinguish between these two states, the existing out-of-VM security solutions require extensive manual analysis. In this paper, we propose an advanced VMM-based, guest-assisted Automated Internal-and-External (A-IntExt) introspection system by leveraging VMI, Memory Forensics Analysis (MFA), and machine learning techniques at the hypervisor. Further, we use the VMI-based technique to introspect digital artifacts of the live guest OS to obtain a semantic view of the processes details. We implemented an Intelligent Cross View Analyzer (ICVA) and implanted it into our proposed A-IntExt system, which examines the data supplied by the VMI to detect hidden, dead, and dubious processes, while also predicting early symptoms of malware execution on the introspected guest OS in a timely manner. Machine learning techniques are used to analyze the executables that are mined and extracted using MFA-based techniques and ascertain the malicious executables. The practicality of the A-IntExt system is evaluated by executing large real-world malware and benign executables onto the live guest OSs. The evaluation results achieved 99.55% accuracy and 0.004 False Positive Rate (FPR) on the 10-fold cross-validation to detect unknown malware on the generated dataset. Additionally, the proposed system was validated against other benchmarked malware datasets and the A-IntExt system outperforms the detection of real-world malware at the VMM with performance exceeding 6.3%. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Feature selection methods; Machine learning techniques; Malware detection; Memory forensics analysis; Semantic gap; Virtual machine introspection; Virtual machine monitor,Artificial intelligence; Computer crime; Computer viruses; Digital storage; E-learning; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Network security; Semantics; Virtual machine; Feature selection methods; Machine learning techniques; Malware detection; Memory forensics; Semantic gap; Virtual machine introspection; Virtual machine monitors; Malware,Elsevier Ltd,English,Digit.

This problem is known to be NP-hard and can be solved by using heuristic as well as any meta-heuristic method. We ponder over the problem of the load balanced transaction scheduling in a grid processing system by using an Ant Colony Optimization for load balancing. The problem that we consider is to achieve good execution characteristics for a given set of transactions that has to be completed within their given deadline. We propose a transaction processing algorithm based on Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) for load balanced transaction scheduling.

Discretization before attribute reduction will result in high computation cost as many irrelevant and redundant attributes need to be discretized. Attribute reduction before discretization may result in over-fitting of the data leading to low performance of the induction algorithm. In this paper, we have proposed a hybrid algorithm using artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm and extended forward tentative selection with backward propagation of selection decision (EFTSBPSD) algorithm for attribute reduction on real-valued data in rough set theory (RST). Based on the principle of indiscernibility, the hybrid ABCEFTSBPSD algorithm performs discretization and attribute reduction together. The hybrid ABCEFTSBPSD algorithm takes as input the decision system consisting of real-valued attributes and determines a near optimal set of irreducible cuts. Here, optimality of the set of irreducible cuts is defined in terms of the cardinality of the set of irreducible cuts. Reduct is obtained from the determined approximate optimal set of irreducible cuts by extracting the attributes corresponding to the cuts in the obtained set of irreducible cuts. The proposed hybrid algorithm is tested on various data sets from University of California Machine Learning Repository. Experimental results obtained by the proposed hybrid algorithm are compared with those obtained by the Q-MDRA, ACO-RST and IMCVR algorithms described in the literature and found to give better classification accuracy when tested using (1) C4.5 classifier and (2) SVM classifier. The proposed hybrid algorithm has also shown reduced length of the reduct in comparison with the results obtained by Q-MDRA, ACO-RST and IMCVR algorithms. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Artificial bee colony algorithm; Attribute reduction; Boolean reasoning; Discretization; FTSBPSD algorithm; Indiscernibility; Rough set theory,Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Computation theory; Data reduction; Decision theory; Evolutionary algorithms; Learning systems; Optimization; Set theory; Artificial bee colony algorithms; Attribute reduction; Boolean reasoning; Discretizations; Indiscernibility; Rough set theory,Springer Verlag,English,Soft Comput.,Article

In general, when an individual engages with an object, say Facebook, Instagram, a Mobile game, or anything else, we know that there is some interest that the person has in the object. However, we do not have a procedure that can tell us by how much of a factor is the person interested. Simply put, can we find a number for someones interest? In this article, we propose the design of a framework that can handle this issue. We formulate the interest estimation problem as a state estimation problem and deduce interest indirectly from the activity. Activity, stimulated by interest, is measured via a subjective-objective weighted approach. Further, we present a novel continuous-time model for interest by drawing inspiration from Physics and Economics simultaneously. We model interest along the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process in Physics and improve the performance by borrowing ideas from Stochastic Volatility Models in Economics. Subsequently, we employ particle filter to solve the interest estimation problem. To validate the feasibility of the proposed theory in practice, we investigate the model by conducting numerical simulations on real-world datasets. The results demonstrate good performance of the framework, and thus match the theoretical expectations from the method. Lastly, we implement the framework in practice and deploy it as a RESTful service, thereby providing a uniform interface for accessing the procedure via any remote or local application. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Artificial intelligence; Interest; Interest estimation; Machine learning; Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process; Statistical application; Stochastic volatility models,Artificial intelligence; Continuous time systems; Economic analysis; Learning systems; Stochastic systems; Automated approach; Continuous time modeling; Estimation problem; Interest; Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process; Real-world datasets; Stochastic Volatility Model; Uniform interface; Stochastic models,Springer New York LLC,English,Appl Intell,Article

Queries for such decision-making are exploratory, long and intricate in nature and involve the summarization and aggregation of data. Furthermore, the rapidly growing volume of data warehouses makes the response times of queries substantially large. The query response times need to be reduced in order to reduce delays in decision-making. Materializing an appropriate subset of views has been found to be an effective alternative for achieving acceptable response times for analytical queries. This problem, being an NP-Complete problem, can be addressed using swarm intelligence techniques. One such technique, i.e., the similarity interaction operator-based particle swarm optimization (SIPSO), has been used to address this problem. Accordingly, a SIPSO-based view selection algorithm (SIPSOVSA), which selects the Top-K views from a multidimensional lattice, has been proposed in this paper. Experimental comparison with the most fundamental view selection algorithm shows that the former is able to select relatively better quality Top-K views for materialization. As a result, the views selected using SIPSOVSA improve the performance of analytical queries that lead to greater efficiency in decision-making. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.",analytical query performance; Data warehouse; quality view selection; similarity interaction operator-based particle swarm optimization; swarm intelligence,Artificial intelligence; Computational complexity; Decision making; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Swarm intelligence; Analytical queries; Experimental comparison; High volumes; Historical data; Query response; Strategic decision making; Swarm intelligence techniques; View selection; Data warehouses,World Scientific Publishing Co.

Though a level of saturation has been obtained in machine printed character recognition, there still remains a void while recognizing handwritten scripts. We, in this paper, have summarized all the existing research efforts on the recognition of printed as well as handwritten Odia alphanumeric characters. Odia is a classical and popular language in the Indian subcontinent used by more than 50 million people. In spite of its rich history, popularity and usefulness, not much research efforts have been made to achieve human level accuracy in case of Odia OCR. This review is expected to serve a benchmark reference for research on Odia character recognition and inspire OCR research communities to make tangible impact on its growth. Here several preprocessing methodologies, segmentation approaches, feature extraction techniques and classifier models with their respective accuracies so far reported are critically reviewed, evaluated and compared. The shortcomings and deficiencies in the current state-of-the-art are discussed in detail for each stage of character recognition. A new handwritten alphanumeric character database for Odia is created and reported in this paper in order to address the paucity of benchmark Odia database. From the existing research work, future research paradigms on Odia character recognition are suggested.

The purpose of this model is to support better investment decisions by forecasting the option price with high predictive accuracy. To further reduce the forecasting error, we incorporate a homogeneity hint (i.e., training the model by categorizing the options data based on moneyness and time-to-maturity of the option contract) into the model. We examine the feasibility and effectiveness of this model using a case study to predict the one-day-ahead price of index options traded in the National Stock Exchange of India Limited. Our experimental results show that the proposed new hybrid model is viable and effective and provides better predictive performance as compared with our benchmark models (standard BS Model, standard Monte Carlo, standard finite difference model, and standard SVR Model).

The closed form expressions are not available for the fractal antennas, so the use of artificial intelligence techniques for their design is appropriate. As the size reduction in rectenna systems used in wireless devices is a significant research domain to meet the demand for reduced size handheld devices, so the geometry of the antenna is selected to achieve this objective and a size reduction of 34.39 % is attained.

But it faces the challenge of weights assignment to features to measure similarity between cases. There are many methods to overcome this feature weighting problem of CBR. However, neural networks pruning is one of the powerful and useful methods to overcome this feature weighting problem, which extracts feature weights from trained neural network without losing the generality of training set by four popular mechanisms: sensitivity, activity, saliency and relevance. It is habitually assumed that the training sets used for learning are balanced.

Therefore, a hybrid CBR system is proposed in this paper to overcome this problem, which adopts a cost-sensitive back-propagation neural network (BPNN) in network pruning to find feature weights. These weights are used in CBR. A single cost parameter is used by the cost-sensitive BPNN to distinguish the importance of class errors. A balanced decision boundary is generated by the cost parameter using prior information. Thus, the class imbalance problem of network pruning is overcome to improve the accuracy of the hybrid CBR. From the empirical results, it is observed that the performance of the proposed hybrid CBR system is better than the hybrid CBR by standard neural network. The performance of the proposed hybrid system is validated with seven datasets. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Artificial neural networks; Case-based reasoning; Data mining; k-NN similarity measure; Similarity measure,Artificial intelligence; Backpropagation; Case based reasoning; Costs; Data mining; Hybrid systems; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Artificial intelligent; Back-propagation neural networks; Case based reasoning systems; Casebased reasonings (CBR); Class imbalance problems; Cost-sensitive neural networks; Similarity measure; Trained neural networks; Problem solving,Springer Verlag,English,Soft Comput.,Article

In this research work, the severity of cracks in the supporting column is assessed using a new technique. This piece of research study uses the soft computing method of fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) to model the domain experts knowledge and the knowledge assimilated through relevant literature to grade the severity of cracks in supporting column. The FCM grading model is further improved by using the Hebbian learning algorithms. The presented work demonstrates the classification and prediction capabilities of FCM for the respective structural health monitoring application, using two well-known and efficient FCM learning approaches viz. nonlinear Hebbian learning (NHL) and data-driven nonlinear Hebbian learning (DD-NHL). The proposed crack severity grading model classifies the cracks in supporting column into three categories, namely fine crack, moderate crack and severe crack. The proposed model uses DD-NHL algorithm. DD-NHL is trained with 70 records and tested with 30 records and gives an overall classification accuracy of 96 %. The obtained results are better compared to other popular machine learning-based classifiers. The proposed method helps even the non-experts to find the possible causes of crack and reports them to structural engineers, to start maintenance in an appropriate stage, using various crack control techniques. Also, a software tool for crack categorization was developed based on the FCM method and its learning capabilities.

Current screening tools use stand-alone plaque texture-based features and therefore lack the ability to stratify the risk. Method This IRB approved study presents a novel strategy for coronary artery disease risk stratification using an amalgamation of IVUS plaque texture-based and wall-based measurement features. Due to common genetic plaque makeup, carotid plaque burden was chosen as a gold standard for risk labels during training-phase of machine learning (ML) paradigm. Cross-validation protocol was adopted to compute the accuracy of the ML framework. A set of 59 plaque texture-based features was padded with six wall-based measurement features to show the improvement in stratification accuracy. The ML system was executed using principle component analysis-based framework for dimensionality reduction and uses support vector machine classifier for training and testing-phases. Results The ML system produced a stratification accuracy of 91.28%, demonstrating an improvement of 5.69% when wall-based measurement features were combined with plaque texture-based features. The fused system showed an improvement in mean sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and area under the curve by: 6.39%, 4.59%, 3.31% and 5.48%, respectively when compared to the stand-alone system. While meeting the stability criteria of 5%, the ML system also showed a high average feature retaining power and mean reliability of 89.32% and 98.24%, respectively.

Many studies have been carried out in the field of defect prediction for imbalanced datasets but most of them uses SMOTE oversampling method to handle the imbalanced data problem. There are many other oversampling methods which help to deal with imbalancing problem and are still unexplored particularly in the field of software defect prediction. This study develops a tool by implementing three of those unexplored oversampling methods namely ADASYN, SPIDER and Safe-Level-SMOTE. Furthermore, we analyze their performance in comparison to traditional method SMOTE. The performance of oversampling methods is evaluated by applying three machine learning techniques for defect prediction using object oriented metrics. The results are evaluated using two open source defect datasets. The result analysis showed that the prediction error decreased and performance of the machine learning techniques improved when balanced datasets were used with respect to three oversampling methods.

The centralized control, being the major advantage of SDN can sometimes also be a major security threat. If the intruder succeeds in attacking the central controller, he would get access to the entire system. The controller is highly vulnerable to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks which lead to exhaustion of the system resources which causes non-availability of the services given by the controller.

It is the method of figuring out all the noun phrases that refer back to the identical real world entity. Several researches have been done in noun phrase coreference resolution by using certain machine learning techniques. Our paper proposes a machine learning approach using support vector machines (SVM) towards coreference resolution at document level. In this research work, 17 welldefined syntactic and semantic features including the 13 baseline features with Semantic Role labeling (SRL) have been used. The use of SVM classifier leads to a better outcome when compared to other machine learning models. The system was evaluated using a machine learning technique and a non-machine learning technique.

Climate forecasting has a highly relevant effect in agricultural fields and industries sectors. The process of predicting climate conditions is required for different areas of life sectors. Handling missing data is significant because a lot of machine learning algorithms performance are affected by missing values in addition, they do not support data with missing values. Various techniques have been used to process missing data problem and the most applied is removing any row that contains at least one missing value. Also, another approaches to solve missing data problems are to impute the missing data to yield a more complete dataset. In order to improve the accuracy of prediction with the climate data, missing value from dataset should be removed or imputed/predicted in the pre-processing phase before using the data for prediction or clustering in the analysis step. In this paper, we propose a new technique to handle missing values in weather data using machine learning algorithms by execute experiments with NCDC dataset to evaluate the prediction error of five methods namely the kernel ridge, linear regression, random forest, SVM imputation and KNN imputation procedure. The missing values were imputed using each method and compared to the observed value.

Due to absence of any in-built authentication, the protocol is vulnerable to a class of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, popularly known as DHCP starvation attacks. However, known DHCP starvation attacks are either ineffective in wireless networks or not stealthy in some of the network topologies. In this paper, we first propose a stealth DHCP starvation attack which is effective in both wired and wireless networks and can not be detected by known detection mechanisms. We test the effectiveness of proposed attack in both IPv4 and IPv6 networks and show that it can successfully prevent other clients from obtaining IP address, thereby, causing DoS scenario. In order to detect the proposed attack, we also propose a Machine Learning (ML) based anomaly detection framework. In particular, we use some popular one-class classifiers for the detection purpose. We capture IPv4 and IPv6 traffic from a real network with thousands of devices and evaluate the detection capability of different machine learning algorithms. Our experiments show that the machine learning algorithms can detect the attack with high accuracy in both IPv4 and IPv6 networks. © 2017 Springer-Verlag France SAS",Anomaly detection; DHCP; DHCP starvation attack; DHCPv6; One-class classifiers,Artificial intelligence; Denial-of-service attack; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Wireless networks; Anomaly detection; DHCP; DHCP starvation attack; DHCPv6; One-class classifier; Internet protocols,Springer-Verlag France,English,J.

However, automatic generation of news comments is a new, challenging and not well-studied task in NLG. Different from other NLG tasks, this task requires the contextual relevance between comments and news. In addition, we need to generate diversified comments, because different people usually have different opinions on the same news in the real world. In this paper, we propose a gated attention neural network model (GANN) to generate news comments. To address the problem of contextual relevance, we introduce the gated attention mechanism to use news context self-Adaptively and selectively. To ensure the diversity of comments, we use random sample and relevance control to generate comments with different topics and degrees of relevance. Moreover, we apply generative adversarial nets to improve GANN. Automatic evaluation with perplexity score reveals that GANN outperforms the existing comment generation methods.

There have been many attempts reported in literature for enhancing security in MANETs. The way of preventing several attacks have been employed so far among which adverting collaborative attacks has become the serious challenge. The nodes which launch collaborative attacks have been detected and eliminated using Collaborative Bait Detection Scheme (CBDS). However, CBDS has failed to enhance the security against the jellyfish attacks which subsequently affect the routing protocol due to poor packet transmission caused by malicious nodes. The present work describes the improved approach for secured transmission by introducing ant colony optimization based clustered based routing protocol (ACO-CBRP). In this method, the clustering of nodes is done using proposed ACO based approach in which the nodes trust value determines routing performance. The nodes having the appropriate trust values enable the calculation of the trust tables of the MANET for detecting the jellyfish attacks. During the process of data transmission, enhanced security can be assured by means of secured key management. The performance evaluation of the present approach is done based on different metrics such as lifetime, overhead and packet delivery ratio using NS-2 simulator platform.

The fusion of such stated artificial intelligence techniques provide an effective tool to optimize multiple conflict objectives and estimate imprecise parameters of the network, simultaneously.

Using a simulated MANET environment and MLP-NN modelling we can illustrate an Intrusion detection System that can successfully detect malicious packet dropping attacks with great accuracy. © 2017 IIMC / IST-Africa.",Artificial Intelligence; Intrusion Detection Systems; Machine Learning; MANET; Multi-layer Perceptron; Network Security,Ad hoc networks; Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Computer crime; Drops; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Mercury (metal); Network layers; Network security; Packet loss; Design and implementations; Destination nodes; Hostile environments; Intrusion Detection Systems; MANET; Multi layer perceptron; Network characteristics; Packet drop attack; Mobile ad hoc networks,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,English,"IST-Africa Week Conf., IST-Africa",Conference Paper

Among them, point of interest (POI) recommendation based on user behaviour has enticed a decent attention. Along with quality of recommendations, the utilization of user feedback has grown to be a key part in the POI recommendations. While implementing similarity-based methods in conventional recommender systems, it faces various issues such as trustworthiness, sparsity and cold-start. The commonness and popularity of social network facilitate people to interact with different users and generate massive data such as user relationships, ratings and interactions. Thus, integration of trust relationship of user in location based social network along with their feedback for POI recommendation is the motivation of this work. In this article, we present a POI recommendation method based on trust enhancement in social networks known as social pertinent trust walker (SPTW). Initially, the level of trust between users in social networks is calculated through matrix factorization technique. Then, SPTW with high probability location category algorithm helps to generate POIs as list of recommendations. Experiments on real-world datasets are conducted to evaluate proposed algorithm for accuracy. Results reveal the effectiveness of approach and quality of recommendations is better, when compared to existing algorithms. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Computational intelligence; Location based social network; Point-of-interest recommendation; Recommender systems; Social pertinent trust walker; Trust enhancement; User preference mining,Artificial intelligence; Factorization; Location; Recommender systems; Social networking (online); Location-based social networks; Matrix factorizations; Point of interest; Preference mining; Quality of recommendations; Recommendation methods; Service recommendations; Similarity-Based Methods; Behavioral research,Springer New York LLC,English,Wireless Pers Commun,Article

In any target data the irrelevant information may be detrimental, causing confusion for the mining algorithm and degrades the prediction outcome. To address this issue, this study attempts to identify an intelligent approach to assist disease diagnostic procedure using an optimal set of attributes instead of all attributes present in the clinical data set. In this proposed Application Specific Intelligent Computing (ASIC) decision support system, a rough set based genetic algorithm is employed in pre-processing phase and a back propagation neural network is applied in training and testing phase. ASIC has two phases, the first phase handles outliers, noisy data, and missing values to obtain a qualitative target data to generate appropriate attribute reduct sets from the input data using rough computing based genetic algorithm centred on a relative fitness function measure. The succeeding phase of this system involves both training and testing of back propagation neural network classifier on the selected reducts. The model performance is evaluated with widely adopted existing classifiers. The proposed ASIC system for clinical decision support has been tested with breast cancer, fertility diagnosis and heart disease data set from the University of California at Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository. The proposed system outperformed the existing approaches attaining the accuracy rate of 95.33%, 97.61%, and 93.04% for breast cancer, fertility issue and heart disease diagnosis. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Clinical decision support; Disease prediction; Feature reduction and hybrid computing; Genetic algorithm; Neural network; Rough set,"accuracy; Article; back propagation; breast cancer; decision support system; false positive result; fertility; genetic algorithm; heart disease; human; medical practice; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; perceptron; prediction; sensitivity and specificity; algorithm; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; expert system; factual database; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Databases, Factual; Expert Systems; Neural Networks (Computer)",Springer New York LLC,English,J.

These are analysed by nodes (amino acids), and these nodes depend upon the probability of next optimized node (amino acids). Nodes have conformational degrees of freedom as well as depend upon the natural factors and collective behaviour of biologically important molecules like temperature, volume, pressure and other ensembles. This biological quantum complexity can be resolved using ACO algorithm. Ants are visually blind and important behaviour of communication among individuals or colony of ant environment is based on chemicals (pheromones) deposited by the ants. Just like ants, proteins are also a group of colony; amino acids are node (amino acid) attached to each others with the help of bonds. This paper is aimed to determine the factors affecting protein folding pattern using ant colony algorithm. Protein occurs structurally in a compact form and determining the ways of protein folding is called NP hard (non-deterministic polynomial-time hard) problem. Using the ACO, we have developed an algorithm for protein folding. It is interesting to note that based on ants ability to find new shorter path between the nest and the food, proteins can also be optimized for shorter path between one node to another node and the folding pattern can be predicted for an unknown protein (ab initio). We have developed an application based on ACO in Perl language (PFEBRT) for determining optimized folding path of proteins. © 2016, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.",ACO; GAFF; Heuristics; Node; NP hard problems; Pheromones,Algorithms; Amino acids; Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Bioinformatics; Computational complexity; Conformations; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Heuristic algorithms; Hormones; Polynomial approximation; Protein folding; Proteins; Ant colony algorithms; Biological complexity; Conformational degrees of freedom; GAFF; Heuristics; Meta-heuristic optimizations; Node; Pheromones; Optimization,Springer London,English,Neural Comput.

Several attempts to secure 802.11 standard ends up with the inadequate security mechanisms that are vulnerable to various attacks and intrusions. Thus, integration of external defense mechanism like intrusion detection system (IDS) is inevitable. An anomaly-based IDS employs machine learning algorithms to detect attacks. Selecting the best set of features is central to ensure the performance of the classifier in terms of speed of learning, accuracy, and reliability. This paper proposes a normalized gain based IDS for MAC Intrusions (NMI) to improve the IDS performance significantly. The proposed NMI includes two primary components OFSNP and DCMI. The first component is optimal feature selection using NG and PSO (OFSNP) and the second component is Detecting and Categorizing MAC 802.11 Intrusions (DCMI) using SVM classifier. The OFSNP ranks the features using an independent measure as normalized gain (NG) and selects the optimal set of features using semi-supervised clustering (SSC). The SSC is based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) that uses labeled and unlabeled features simultaneously to find a group of optimal features. Using the optimal set of features, the proposed DCMI utilizes a rapid and straightforward support vector machine (SVM) learning that classifies the attacks under the appropriate classes. Thus, the proposed NMI achieves a better trade-off between detection accuracy and learning time. The experimental results show that the NMI accurately detects and classifies the 802.11 specific intrusions and also, it reduces the false positives and computation complexity by decreasing the number of features. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Intrusion detection system; MAC 802.11; Normalized gain (NG); Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Support vector machine (SVM) classifier; WLAN,Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Clustering algorithms; Complex networks; Computer crime; Economic and social effects; Intrusion detection; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Mercury (metal); Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Support vector machines; Wi-Fi; Wireless telecommunication systems; Anomaly-based intrusion detection; Computation complexity; Intrusion Detection Systems; MAC 802.11; Normalized gains; Optimal feature selections; Semi-supervised Clustering; WLAN; Feature extraction,Springer New York LLC,English,Wireless Networks,Article

An opinion is a statement about a subject which expresses the sentiments as well as the emotions of the opinion makers on the topic. In this paper, we develop a sentiment analysis tool namely SENTI-METER. This tool estimates the success rate of social campaigns based on the algorithms we developed that analyze the sentiment of word as well as blog. Social campaigns have a huge impact on the mindset of people. One such campaign was launched in India on October 2, 2014, named Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (SBA). Our tool computes an elaborated analysis of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, which examines the success rate of this social campaign. Here, we performed the location-wise analysis of the campaign and predict the degree of polarity of tweets along with the monthly and weekly analysis of the tweets. The experiments were conducted in five phases namely extraction and preprocessing of tweets, tokenization, sentiment evaluation of a line, sentiment evaluation of a blog (document) and analysis. Our tool is also capable of handling transliterated words.

HMNNA consists of three neural networks trained specifically on different areas of problem space under consideration, and the trained networks are then arranged in a tree structure forming hierarchical modular neural network architecture. The three specialized neural networks are trained by LevenbergMaarquardt neural network algorithm. As compared to the standard back propagation algorithm, LevenbergMaarquardt is fast and stable for convergence with only one drawback, i.e., storage requirement for estimated Hessian Matrix. For training and testing of HMNNA, a huge primary database is created which contains 8091 cervical cell images pertaining to 200 clinical cases collected from two health care institutions of northern India. The raw cases of cervical cancer in the form of Pap smear slides were photographed under a multi-headed digital microscope. Individual cells were manually cropped off from these slide images which were then passed through a feature extraction module for morphological profiling. Each cell was calibrated on the basis of 40 features from both cytoplasm and nucleus. After profiling, these cells were vigilantly assigned cell classes as per the latest 2001-Bethesda system of cervical cancer cell classification, by trained cytotechnicians and histopathologists. HMNNA is also trained and tested on the Herlev Benchmark dataset created by the Denmark University, which consists of 1417 cervical cancer cells. Both the datasets have seven classes of diagnosis, i.e., superficial squamous, intermediate squamous, columnar, mild dysplasia, moderate dysplasia, severe dysplasia, and carcinoma in situ, corresponding to the level of abnormality in cervical cells. These datasets are available in public domain at http://digitalpapsmeardb.in/and http://mde-lab.aegean.gr/index.php/downloads.The screening potential of the HMNNA is compared with 25 well-known machine learning algorithms available in MatlabR2016 (Machine learning and statistics toolbox 10.2) and monolithic neural network algorithms available in Matlab neural network pattern recognition toolbox. The HMNNA outperformed in all the 25 algorithms for both the datasets. For the Novel Benchmark database, it produced a classification accuracy of 95.32% with an F-value of 0.949310 and classification accuracy of 88.41% with an F-value of 0.89145 for the Herlev dataset. The screening potential of HMNNA was also evaluated and compared with the other diagnostic systems available in the recently published literature and was found to be performing much better than the counterparts on multiple parameters of performance evaluation. © 2017 The Natural Computing Applications Forum",Cervical cancer; Machine learning; Modular neural networks; Neural networks; Pap smear test,Artificial intelligence; Automation; Backpropagation; Backpropagation algorithms; Cells; Classification (of information); Computerized tomography; Cytology; Database systems; Digital devices; Diseases; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Neural networks; Pattern recognition; Trees (mathematics); Cervical cancer cells; Cervical cancers; Classification accuracy; Modular neural networks; Neural network algorithm; Pap smear; Standard back propagation algorithms; Storage requirements; Network architecture,Springer London,English,Neural Comput.

The classification using the different machine learning technique leads for over fitting and under fitting. To select the optimized feature is a difficult task. The high dimension feature vector requires a high computational cost. The hand craft feature selection machine learning techniques performed poor. We have used the incremental feature selection strategy for feature selection. In this paper we first selected the feature and identify the principle feature then we classify gait data using different machine learning technique (KNN, ANN, SVM, DNN and classifier fusion) and shown the performance comparison. Experimental result on real time datasets propose method is better than previous method as far as humanoid locomotion classification is concerned and the generalization accuracy provided by new feature selection method i.e. incremental feature selection (IFS) with analysis of variance (ANOVA) (Zhang et al., 20). During the feature extraction, 17 features were selected from the existing literatures (Wang et al. in IEEE Trans Circ Syst Video Technol 14(2):149158, 15). Using all the features could lead to over fitting, information redundancy and dimension disaster. Thus, a system with optimal features was selected using ANOVA combined with IFA. These selected features were then fed as an input to the ANN, SVM, KNN and DNN model. These individual classifiers were combined to produce classifier fusion model. The 5-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. Based on the empirical results it may be concluded that classifier fusion provides satisfactory results (92.23 %) compared to other individual classifiers.

It is one of the most widely spread cancer among women. As per the survey, one out of eight women in the world are at risk of breast cancer at some point of time in her life. One of the methods to reduce breast cancer mortality rate is timely detection and effective treatment. That is why, more accurate classification of a breast cancer tumor has become a challenging problem in the medical field. Many classification techniques are proposed in the literature. Today, expert systems and machine learning techniques are being extensively used in the breast cancer classification problem. They provide high classification accuracy and effective diagnostic capabilities. In this paper, we have proposed a novel Gauss-Newton representation based algorithm (GNRBA) for breast cancer classification. It uses the sparse representation with training sample selection. Until now, sparse representation has been successfully applied in pattern recognition only. The proposed method introduces a novel Gauss-Newton based approach to find the optimal weights for the training samples for classification. In addition, it evaluates the sparsity in a computationally efficient way as compared to the conventional l1-norm method. The effectiveness of the GNRBA is examined on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database (WBCD) and the Wisconsin Diagnosis Breast Cancer (WDBC) database from the UCI Machine Learning repository. Various performance measures like classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, confusion matrices, a statistical test and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) are reported to show the superiority of the proposed method as compared to classical models. The experimental results show that the proposed GNRBA could be a good alternative for breast cancer classification for clinical experts. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Breast cancer classification; Euclidean distance measure; Gauss-Newton representation based algorithm; Sparse representation,Artificial intelligence; Diagnosis; Expert systems; Gaussian distribution; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Pattern recognition; Sampling; Breast cancer classifications; Euclidean distance measure; Gauss Newton; Gauss-Newton based approach; Machine learning techniques; Receiver operating characteristics; Sparse representation; UCI machine learning repository; Diseases,Elsevier Ltd,English,Expert Sys Appl,Article

Conventional medical image classification algorithms usually neglect the semantic gap problem between low-level features and high-level image semantic, which will largely degrade the classification performance. To solve this problem, we propose a multi-scale non-negative sparse coding based medical image classification algorithm. Firstly, Medical images are decomposed into multiple scale layers, thus diverse visual details can be extracted from different scale layers. Secondly, for each scale layer, the non-negative sparse coding model with fisher discriminative analysis is constructed to obtain the discriminative sparse representation of medical images. Then, the obtained multi-scale non-negative sparse coding features are combined to form a multi-scale feature histogram as the final representation for a medical image. Finally, SVM classifier is combined to conduct medical image classification. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can effectively utilize multi-scale and contextual spatial information of medical images, reduce the semantic gap in a large degree and improve medical image classification performance. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Fisher discriminative analysis; Medical image classification; Multi-scale decomposition; Non-negative sparse coding; The semantic gap,"Classification (of information); Codes (symbols); Computer aided diagnosis; Image analysis; Image classification; Image coding; Image enhancement; Semantics; Classification performance; Contextual spatial information; Fisher discriminative analysis; Medical imaging technology; Multi-scale Decomposition; Non-negative sparse coding; Semantic gap; Sparse representation; Medical imaging; accuracy; algorithm; Article; coding; histogram; image analysis; medical image classification; multi scale non negative sparse coding; priority journal; sensitivity and specificity; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; classification; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; human; predictive value; procedures; receiver operating characteristic; Artificial Intelligence; Diagnostic Imaging; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Predictive Value of Tests; ROC Curve",Elsevier B.V.,English,Artif.

With increasing volume and velocity of data handled by these applications, known as the bigdata problem, traditional recommendation systems that analyze data and update models at regular time intervals would not be able to satisfy this requirement. With the evolution of technologies for processing bigdata in real time, it has become fairly easy to implement real time recommendation systems. Stream-computing is a new computing paradigm for handling the velocity attribute of bigdata which makes it possible to develop real time bigdata applications. This paper gives the details of implementation of a real time recommendation system using Apache Spark, a widely used platform for stream computing. This system is implemented for recommending TV channels to viewers in real time. This becomes a challenging task due to continuous changes in the set of available channels and the context dependent preference of viewers. In channel recommendation scenario, characterized by its dynamic nature, volume of data, and tight time constraints, traditional approaches cannot be used. We have implemented a highly scalable TV channel recommendation system optimized for the processing of real-time data streams originating from set-top boxes. The proposed system implements a self-adaptive approach for model building. The system effectively uses distributed processing power of Apache Spark to make recommendations in real time with scalability to meet the real time constraints with increasing load. The Spark Machine Learning Libraries (Spark MLLib) provide several algorithms which were used for developing the proposed recommendation system. The large amount of data in the system is efficiently managed by the data processing method of Lambda Architecture. © 2017 IEEE.",Machine Learning; Real-Time Recommendation Engine; Spark Streaming,Artificial intelligence; Data handling; Food products; Learning systems; Libraries; Real time systems; Set-top boxes; Signal processing; Data processing methods; Distributed processing; Evolution of technology; Real time; Real time constraints; Real-time data streams; Self adaptive approach; Traditional approaches; Recommender systems,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,English,"IEEE Int.

In recent years, plant species recognition is carried out based on the shape, geometry and texture of various plant parts such as leaves, stem, flowers etc. Flower based plant species identification systems are widely used. While modern search engines provide methods to visually search for a query image that contains a flower, it lacks in robustness because of the intra-class variation among millions of flower species around the world. Hence in this proposed research work, a Deep learning approach using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is used to recognize flower species with high accuracy. Images of the plant species are acquired using the built-in camera module of a mobile phone. Feature extraction of flower images is performed using a Transfer Learning approach (i.e. extraction of complex features from a pre-trained network). A machine learning classifier such as Logistic Regression or Random Forest is used on top of it to yield a higher accuracy rate. This approach helps in minimizing the hardware requirement needed to perform the computationally intensive task of training a CNN. It is observed that, CNN combined with Transfer Learning approach as feature extractor outperforms all the handcrafted feature extraction methods such as Local Binary Pattern (LBP), Color Channel Statistics, Color Histograms, Haralick Texture, Hu Moments and Zernike Moments.

It is primarily used for finding patterns that are validated through statistical methods, in the context of brain connectivity. Quantification of functional connectivity is usually performed using Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC). Many Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have used PCC to quantify functional connectivity in a bivalent sense. However, the interpretation of negative fMRI responses or deactivation has proved challenging. Therefore, few have employed the absolute value of PCC (univalent) to model functional connectivity. This paper compares the two measures and assesses their performance and suitability for fMRI connectivity modeling. Connectivity analysis and classification of autistic individuals from control population is performed using these two measures. Machine learning classification is employed to quantify the predictive abilities of univalent and bivalent functional connectivity measures. This paper experimentally finds the usage of bivalent measure to be producing better classification accuracy by around 2%, which means it is more suitable for fMRI functional connectivity analysis. © 2017 IEEE.",Functional connectivity; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; machine learning; Pearson' scorrelation coefficient,Artificial intelligence; Brain; Correlation methods; Learning systems; Magnetic resonance imaging; Stochastic systems; Classification accuracy; Connectivity analysis; Functional connectivity; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Machine learning classification; Pearson' scorrelation coefficient; Pearson's correlation coefficients; Predictive abilities; Signal processing,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,English,"Int.

Here we have taken third order microstrip Lowpass filter with cut off frequency of 2 GHz, FR-4 lossy is used as a substrate with dielectric constant 4.3. Richard's transformation and Kuruda's identity have been used to convert the lumped elements into the distributed line elements to realize the filter. Two different shapes of CSRR have been considered for carrying out exact cut off frequency. Instead of increasing the order of filter we use square and circular shapes of CSRR's with host transmission line in the ground plane.

Clustering is either classified as static and dynamic or as equal and unequal. In cluster based routing protocols that employ multi-hop communication, imbalanced energy consumption among the nodes results in hot-spots. Unequal clustering overcomes hot-spots but requires a high overhead and is prone to connectivity issues. To offer guaranteed connectivity and alleviate the hot-spot problem, a zone divisional hierarchical routing protocol has been proposed in this paper. The network is divided into equal sized static rectangular clusters which are assigned to two zones namely near zone and far zone. The zone facing the base station is known as the near zone and rest of the network space makes up the far zone which is further divided into sub-zones. Dual cluster heads approach for sharing the reception, aggregation and forwarding tasks is proposed. The performance evaluation of the proposed protocol against the existing protocols reveals that the method offers energy-efficient multi-hop communication support, uses negligible overhead, prevents creation of hot-spots, avoids early death of nodes, uses balanced energy consumption across the network and maximizes the network lifetime. © 2016 IEEE.",clustering; hot-spots; multi-hop; network lifetime,Artificial intelligence; Energy efficiency; Energy resources; Energy utilization; Internet protocols; Power management (telecommunication); Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Balanced energy consumption; Cluster based routing protocols; clustering; Communication bandwidth; Hierarchical routing protocol; Hot spot; Multihop; Network lifetime; Wireless sensor networks,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,English,"Proc. - Int.

The growth in the number of images that are being uploaded has brought a need to develop systems that can store, process and organize them as how and when needed. A survey conducted on working ability of famous e-commerce systems has brought into light the need for semantic integration in recommendation systems. This paper proposes a framework in which images are recommended to users based on their semantic integration. This integration is made possible by using tags and surrounding text of an image to determine their semantic association. In this paper four semantic relatedness methods are used. The methods are Jaccard similarity of sets, Dice, edit distance and Overlap, these techniques are compared to find the best semantic recommendation. The proposed system has wide application in recommendation systems such as image recommendation in social networking, books recommendation, movie recommendation and product recommendation in e-commerce websites. © 2016 IEEE.",Dice; edit distance; Jaccard similarities; Overlap; recommendation; semantic techniques,Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Electronic commerce; Integration; Multimedia systems; Recommender systems; Social networking (online); Dice; Edit distance; Jaccard similarities; Overlap; recommendation; Semantic techniques; Semantics,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,English,"Proc. - Int.

These nodes are battery powered due to which energy of a node plays a vital role. The amount of the energy used up by any node while the data is transmitted, it needs to be optimized so that the less amount of energy is consumed. The efficiency of the WSN depends on the numerous performance parameter of the network. A lifetime of network and energy consumption is the most important parameters in the design of a WSN.

Severe injuries, property losses and environmental pollution are happened by fire accidents. We are unable to control problem due to undeveloped fire alert systems and lack of synchronization with advanced technologies. Time delay, false alarm and inaccuracy make traditional electronic fire alert systems insufficient to fulfill our requirements. There is need to develop more accurate, wireless, real time, automatic fire alert system that gives information like degree of fire or spread of fire, location of accidental site etc. Presenting system is designed to fulfill user requirements which consist of micro-controller, RF module, GSM and two types of sensors. System is initialized and set the longitude & latitude of location by switches as well as Temperature & IR Sensors are placed at appropriate locations in building to determine fire-happening then Wireless communication is made possible by RF module, If fire is detected then micro-controller are used to calculate fire affected area and quantity of extinguisher required by preset data. This information and URL address of affected location is send to fire control office by GSM module. GOOGLE MAP is used to trace the affected location and timely rescue operation is made possible.

In hostile environment some node may deny to forward packet in order to disrupt regular communications, this type of abnormal behavior is referred as packet drop attack or blackhole attack. Most of the techniques that are used to mitigate blackhole attack are based on the use of destination sequence number as a criterion to identify blackhole node. However, these schemes have limitation of quantifying the value of destination sequence number that is used to identify a blackhole node. As a result, attacker can change the value of destination sequence number according to value present in RREQ (Route REQuest) packet.

An algorithm is developed by CART to identify the most sensitive buses which are most viable and hampered the security of power system. Such buses are ranked in terms of their index called joint bus ranking. PMUs are costly devices and should be placed only on such buses which affect the security most. Therefore only top ranked buses are selected to place the PMUs instead of all buses. On comparisons between PMU placed at all buses with optimally selected PMU buses, classification accuracy is observed more for optimally selected PMU buses. As numbers of PMUs are reduced with higher classification accuracy, reduces the cost of PMU devices in overall system.

Generally, in large conversational dataset like Twitter it is very difficult to identifying public health-related topics. Machine learning is the area which helps us to overcome this situation. By applying probabilistic unsupervised machine learning we have identified latent topics from the text corpora. Topic modeling algorithms are probabilistic generative models which is used to analyze the words of the original texts to identify themes that run through them, how connected to each other by themes, and how the topics change over (Blei in Commun ACM 55(4):7784, 2012). In this paper we have proposed a framework for recommending health-related topics by applying an enhanced topic model hierarchical latent Dirichlet allocation for identifying public health-related topics and themes in tweets.

Communication among nodes influences their relationship. Relationship among nodes may be visible or invisible. The relationship among members of social networks passes through three stages of life cycles which are primary stage, secondary stage and termination Stage. Primary stages are those stages in which the relationship among two or more nodes are established. This relationship may be direct (i.e., one to one or one to many) and indirect (i.e., mutual relation, virtual relation etc.). Secondary stages are those stages in which the communication among nodes (i.e. members of social networks) starts. But there is always uncertainty related to communication among nodes of social networks. There may be chances that communication among nodes with each other may be for gap of short duration, medium duration or long duration. A sender may send a message to different others members of social networks but he may not get certain response on a message. Types of response on a message establishes the different kinds of relationship.

In Mesochronous operation, data are processed in one or more processing clocks based on executing instructions. In this scheme, a delayed clock pulse is allotted for each instruction in the processing unit. Due to different clock frequencies for different instructions, the overhead of clock allocation is large. The conventional models derive the clock delay per cycle, building a large overhead in Mesochronous operation. This overhead is reduced, by a register alignment logic, where the redundancy of instructions are realigned in a clock Look Up Table (LUT), and an instruction index alignment is proposed to minimize the switching overhead of clock allocation for Mesochronous operation.

The control parameters were designed to regulate the ATR reaction temperature by manipulating air flow rate by using a classical root locus principle. This feedback control design using root locus method was also compared with an internal model control (IMC) method for two strategies of controller design both with and without the feed temperature control to locate the appropriate controller system when the ambient temperature is a major disturbance for cold weather. The simulation results showed that the root locus technique provides better performance than the IMC control technique as given faster rise time than that one. In addition, both control techniques can maintain the response of control variable within the required conditions. As two loops of control system were analyzed, the ATR process combined with the feed temperature control loop can compensate the ambient temperature better than without the feed control loop. It can be concluded that the feedback control strategy using root locus technique can reach desired performance for sustain the adiabatic ATR temperature and give the faster response to control the ATR temperature than IMC method. © 2016 IEEE.",autothermal reformer; feedback control; internal model control; root locus,Artificial intelligence; Feedback; Feedback control; Fuel cells; Model predictive control; Root loci; Temperature; Temperature control; Autothermal reformers; Controller designs; Controller systems; Feedback control strategies; Feedback controller design; Internal model control; Reaction temperature; Root locus technique; Controllers,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,English,"Proc. - Int.

Load balancing basically balances the load to achieve higher throughput and better resource utilization. Since scheduling task is NP-complete problem, so heuristic and meta heuristic approaches are preferred options to solve the same. In this paper, we chose a meta-heuristic approach of Ant colony optimization algorithm to solve the task scheduling problem in cloud environment focussing mainly on two objectives, i.e., minimizing the makespan/ computation time and better load balancing. Comparative analysis shows that proposed load balancing ant colony optimization algorithm (LB-ACO) provides better results than NSGA-II algorithm by providing better load balancing and less makespan.

Applications generated by the devices are diverse in nature, for each application bandwidth and delay requirements vary. The flows in the network compete for a constrained resource such as bandwidth or low latency path, an intelligent flow routing algorithm becomes a natural demand. Better overall network performance could be achieved only if the network is capable of prioritizing the flows and assign resources based on their application specific requirement. Our proposed, AMPS controller is capable of prioritizing each of the flow using MLT, and assign a path based on its classified priority. AMPS controller supports routing flows through different path even if the flows are between the same pair of nodes. The path finding algorithm employs Yen-K-shortest path algorithm, also it supports scalable flow routing for a large volume of flows. We have implemented the flow routing algorithm in OpenvSwitch as a proof of concept. A significant improvement is observed in comparison to SDN with traditional routing techniques involving a large number of flows. The proposed flow routing algorithm ensures high availability of an unloaded path for high priority flows even in a heavily loaded network. © 2017 IEEE.",,Application programs; Artificial intelligence; Bandwidth; Learning systems; Network routing; Routers; Application specific requirements; Constrained resources; Controller support; High availability; K-shortest path algorithms; Machine learning techniques; Path-finding algorithms; Routing techniques; Routing algorithms,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,English,"Natl.

Classification of normal and aggressive actions are essential for diseases and prosthetic arm controls. But accurate classification of physical actions are sometimes not possible using raw EMG signals. To enhance the classification accuracy feature extraction is an essential criterion. Hence in this work wavelet analysis is used for feature extraction from EMG signals to provide a suitable pattern to the ANFIS based classifier. The EMG signals are decomposed using DB-4 wavelet up to level 5 and approximate coefficients are extracted. Approximate coefficients from the signals are taken as input to the ANFIS module to classify the physical actions. The proposed method is validated using various test cases and it is observed that accuracy of the proposed method is up to 98% from all the tested cases. © 2017 IEEE.,ANFIS; Artificial Intelligence; Electromyography (EMG); Physical Action Classification; Signal Processing; Wavelet analysis,Artificial intelligence; Electromyography; Extraction; Feature extraction; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Nanotechnology; Signal processing; Wavelet analysis; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; ANFIS; Classification accuracy; Electromyography signals; EMG signal; Intelligent method; Physical action; Prosthetic arm; Biomedical signal processing,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,English,"Int.

As we know, the primary aim of artificial intelligence or robotic research is not only to develop advanced programs to solve our problems but also to reproduce mental qualities in machines. The critical claim of artificial intelligence (AI) advocates is that there is no distinction between mind and machines and thus they argue that there are possibilities for machine ethics, just as human ethics. Unlike computer ethics, which has traditionally focused on ethical issues surrounding human use of machines, AI or machine ethics is concerned with the behaviour of machines towards human users and perhaps other machines as well, and the ethicality of these interactions. The ultimate goal of machine ethics, according to the AI scientists, is to create a machine that itself follows an ideal ethical principle or a set of principles; that is to say, it is guided by this principle or these principles in decisions it makes about possible courses of action it could take. Thus, machine ethics task of ensuring ethical behaviour of an artificial agent. Although, there are many philosophical issues related to artificial intelligence, but our attempt in this paper is to discuss, first, whether ethics is the sort of thing that can be computed. Second, if we are ascribing mind to machines, it gives rise to ethical issues regarding machines. And if we are not drawing the difference between mind and machines, we are not only redefining specifically human mind but also the society as a whole. Having a mind is, among other things, having the capacity to make voluntary decisions and actions. The notion of mind is central to our ethical thinking, and this is because the human mind is self-conscious, and this is a property that machines lack, as yet. © 2017 Springer-Verlag London Ltd.",Artificial intelligence; Artificial moral agent; Mind; Moral agency; Subjectivity,Artificial intelligence; Human computer interaction; Intelligent robots; Artificial agents; Computer ethics; Ethical issues; Ethical principles; Mind; Moral agency; Moral agents; Subjectivity; Philosophical aspects,Springer London,English,AI Soc.,Article in Press

To explore this question, we developed and carried out tactile ideation work-shops with participants in the UK and India.

Classification of the ground surface into several classes facilitate in understanding the changes caused by climate, natural and human activities. For this purpose, hyperspectral images provide high spectral information. Due to poor spatial resolution the IFOV of the sensor contains many classes and the spectra obtained are often mixture of two classes. This results in misclassification. In this paper, sub-pixel analysis of hyperspectral images is carried out to deal with the mixed pixel problem. We propose a technique based on Ant Colony Optimization(ACO) which utilizes the spectral information to generate spatially high resolution images. Sub-pixel mapping implies division of mixed pixels into sub-pixels and allocating classes to them based on spatial contiguity and abundance fractions.

Initially, linear model such as ARIMA has been applied to forecast sales. ARIMA was not able to capture nonlinear patterns precisely, hence nonlinear models such as Neural Network, XGBoost and SVM were used. Nonlinear models performed better than ARIMA and gave low RMSE. Then, to further optimize the performance, composite models were designed using hybrid technique and decomposition technique. Hybrid ARIMA-ARNN, Hybrid ARIMA-XGBoost, Hybrid ARIMA-SVM were used and all of them performed better than their respective individual models. Then, the composite model was designed using STL Decomposition where the decomposed components namely seasonal, trend and remainder components were forecasted by Snaive, ARIMA and XGBoost.

One of the most important and challenging issue in the data stream domain is the classification of the big datasets. However the conventional classification methods developed to run in a streaming environment with high use of memory constraints and longer execution running time. Another three major important issues in the data stream classification methods are huge length, conception drift and Feature Selection (FS). In this review paper, we consider the difficult problem of FS algorithms for streaming data, in which the size of streaming data for the feature set is unknown, primary to an inflexible demand in computation constraints, and not every feature is available from classifier model. In order to solve this difficulty, Swarm Intelligence (SI) algorithms are performed on the high dimensionality and streaming big dataset samples which result in increase classification accuracy, less memory consumption and lesser running time when compared to the existing streaming FS algorithms on various datasets. The proposed SI based FS algorithms overcomes the difficulty of the traditional FS algorithms. © 2017 IEEE.",Big data; Data Stream Mining; Data streams classification; Feature Selection (FS); metaheuristics; Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO); Swarm Intelligence (SI),Artificial intelligence; Big data; Data handling; Data mining; Feature extraction; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Signal processing; Swarm intelligence; Classification accuracy; Conventional classification methods; Data stream; Data stream classifications; Data stream mining; Feature selection algorithm; Hardware and software; Meta heuristics; Classification (of information),Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,English,"Proc.

Time delay in VLSI routing is affected by multiple parameters such as buffer size, area usage, wire length, power dissipation and clock frequency. Reducing the wire length is the most common circuit optimization performed to combat problems arising from the exponential increase in transistor density of integrated circuits as predicted by Moore's Law. Simultaneous buffer insertion with wirelength minimization reduces routing delay further than only minimizing the total length of the routing path. Metaheuristic algorithms like Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Firefly Algorithm (FA) have already been applied to this optimization process to obtain the optimal circuit implementation with acceptable approximations. This paper demonstrates how Invasive Weed Optimization (IWO) algorithm can be used to find the shortest routing path with simultaneous buffer insertion.

The traditional approach for detection and classification of fruit and its maturity level is based on the naked eye observation by the experts, which is both time consuming and causes eye fatigue. Advance techniques in image processing and machine learning helps to automatic classify and count the fruits, accurately, quickly and non-destructively. A method to automatic detect and classify apple fruit maturity level, whether it is mature or immature based on its color features has been proposed. Images of the apple are resized and Image Processing Techniques are applied for the extraction of apple color components (R, G, B). Artificial Neural Network is used as a classifier to identify and count the mature and immature applesusingcolor components. The proposed model has an accuracy of 98.1%, when all the three attributes are used as an input. © 2017 IEEE.",Back Propagation Feed Forward Neural Network; classification; features extraction; Machine Learning; RGB,Artificial intelligence; Backpropagation; Classification (of information); Extraction; Fruits; Learning systems; Neural networks; Signal processing; Apple fruits; Color component; Color features; Eye fatigue; Features extraction; Image processing technique; Maturity levels; Traditional approaches; Image processing,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,English,"Proc.

The management and processing of huge data sets are time-consuming, costly, and hindrance to research. So, the process to store, manage, analyze and extract meaningful value from the vast volume of data is a big challenge to researchers. Data warehouse is a Decision Support System (DSS) technology that allows extracting, grouping and analyzing historical data from different sources in order to discover information relevant to decision making. Climate data is collected and stored in the national climatic data center (NCDC), the format of dataset support a rich set of meteorological elements. The data warehouse has the ability to manage data having a huge size in Terabytes range or higher, data is collected from different meteorological stations and stored in records to analyze it later in future. The process of big data analysis has become increasingly important for climate analysis field, which requires rapid and transparent data access. Recently, a new distributed computing paradigm, called MapReduce and it is implemented in an open source Hadoop, which has been widely adopted due to its impressive scalability and flexibility to handle structured, unstructured and semi-structured data. The purpose of this paper is to develop a conceptual data model and the implementation of hybrid data warehouse model to store NCDC's weather variables. The hybrid data warehouse model for climate big data enables the identification of weather patterns that would be useful for agriculture fields, climatic change studies and contingency plans over weather extreme conditions. © 2017 IEEE.",Data Warehouse; Hadoop; Hive; NCDC data set; Pig; Sqoop; Weather,Artificial intelligence; Climate change; Climate models; Computer circuits; Data handling; Data warehouses; Decision making; Decision support systems; Distributed computer systems; Information analysis; Open systems; Weathering; Conceptual data modeling; Data set; Decision support system (dss); Hadoop; Hive; Meteorological elements; National climatic data centers; Sqoop; Big data,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,English,"Proc.

In this scheme, multiple secrets are reconstructed stage by stage in the dealer's predetermined order, and only one secret shadow is kept by every participant. Later Harn improved the He and Dawson's scheme to reduce the total number of public values. But Chang et al. showed that both He and Dawson's scheme and Harn's scheme are not multi use schemes and secrets are not infact reconstructed stage by stage and proposed a new scheme to deal with these problems.

The extracted aspects are fine-grained for the presentation form known as Review Highlights. The syntactic approach for extraction process suffers from the overlapping chunking rules which result in noise extraction. We introduce a hybrid technique which combines machine learning and rule based model. A multi-label classifier identifies the effective rules which efficiently parse aspects and opinions from texts. This selection of rules reduce the amount of noise in extraction tasks. This is a novel attempt to learn syntactic rule fitness from a corpus using machine learning for accurate aspect extraction. As the model learns the syntactic rule prediction from the corpus, it makes the extraction method domain independent. It also allows studying the quality of syntactic rules in a different corpus. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Atmospheric disturbances have a significant impact on performance of FSO Link which results in the degradation of the laser beam. In this paper, the analysis and investigation based on experimental set-up for a Free Space optical communication link at wavelength of 532nm and 850nm is being carried out which helps to evaluate the link performance and further improvement in link performance is done by experimental arrangement. The FSO link in case of 532nm tolerate attenuation up to 66.12 dB/km at the loss of -0.04 dB and rain rate of 2.3592mm/min. whereas 850nm tolerate attenuation up to 17.5 dB/km at the loss of -0.01 dB and at the same rain rate as in 532nm. The experimental investigation is carried out by analyzing the receiver current, exposed length and rain rate conditions. It is concluded that the proposed FSO link of 532nm having more attenuation than 850nm wavelength and in the both the cases loss is assumed of -0.01 dB. There is an increase in attenuation when rain rate increases. The rain rate over the exposed lengths depends on the different rain drop sizes.

Texture is an important spatial feature, useful for identifying facial objects of interest in an image. The most popular statistical methods used to measure the textural information of images are the grey level cooccurrence matrix (GLCM) and the texture spectrum (TS) Approach. The major problem of these two approaches is the dimensionality. This paper derives significant local information by deriving a new integrated matrix using fuzzy based texture unit and GLCM for efficient face recognition. The features derived from this integrated matrix provide detailed and complete texture information of about the human faces. Local binary pattern (LBP) operator is a powerful operator to extract the discriminative facial features and this method may fail to detect the illumination variation and facial expressions accurately.

This paper highlights the application of classifying and predicting a specific disease by implementing the operations on medical data generated in the field of medical and healthcare. In this project an efficient multiclass Naïve Bayes algorithm is used for prediction of a particular disease by training it on a set of data before implementation. Wrong clinical decisions taken by medical practitioners can cause any harm or result in serious loss of life of a patient which is hard to afford by any hospital. To acquire a precise and cost effective treatment, technology based Data Mining Systems can be constructed to make worthy decisions. The main aim of this project is to build a basic decision support system which can determine and extract previously unseen patterns, relations and concepts related with multiple disease from a historical database records of specified multiple diseases. The proposed system can solve difficult queries for detecting a particular disease and also can assist medical practitioners to make smart clinical decisions which traditional decision support systems were not able to. The decisions taken by medical practitioners with the help of technology can result in effective and low cost treatments. There is an insufficiency of technology and analysis system and methods to discover connections, concepts and patterns in the medical data. Data mining is an engineering study of extracting previously undiscovered patterns from a selected set of data. In this paper, data mining methods namely, Naive Bayes and J48 algorithms are compared for testing their accuracy and performance on the training medical datasets. The medical datasets will be visualized by different visualization techniques like 2D/3D graphs, pie charts and other methods. The algorithms mentioned above are compared and evaluated on basis of their accuracy and time consumption factors. The algorithm which gives out high accuracy in the comparative study is selected for implementation for developing the system. © 2017 IEEE.",Classification; Datasets; Decision tree; Genetic Algorithm; Naive Bayes; Prediction,Artificial intelligence; Big data; Classification (of information); Classifiers; Cost effectiveness; Data visualization; Decision support systems; Decision trees; Diagnosis; Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Health care; Medical computing; Trees (mathematics); Visualization; Comparative studies; Cost effective treatments; Data mining methods; Datasets; Historical database; Medical practitioner; Naive bayes; Visualization technique; Data mining,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,English,"Proc.

While most of the creators prefer to keep the content free by allowing ads, these Ad blockers are causing harm. They are useful to block spam ads but without any means of segregation between good or bad, it is prone to block 'Advertisements'. This paper focuses on how the Business analysis could be employed to construct a strategy that companies that display written content like e-newspapers & e-magazines could employ to deal with the threat posed by Advertisement blocking software. The problem statement is explained in four phases of Business Analytics: Operations Analytics studied the models that predict the effect of the Ad-blockers on the organization; Customer Analytics guided the research by predicting the customer behaviour, marketing decisions, and Strategy. Accounting Analytics dealt with how the Ad-blockers affect the company's financial bottom line. Finally, People Analytics suggested the measures that strengthen the company's internal organization to deal with Ad-blockers. The main strategy to tackle this issue was taken from Wharton's Future of Advertising (WFoA) program's R.A.V.E.S.[1] that is an advertisement must be relevant and respectful, actionable, valuable and value generating with exceptional experience and share-worthy story from the end user. Alternative strategies like Enhancing the User Experience in the mobile application, collaborating and sharing knowledge articles with similar companies was also discussed. The anticipated effects of the proposed strategy were measured through various metrics that included customer satisfaction levels through paid apps, subscription fees, pay-per-click thoughts. Key drivers to the customer's chance of viewing the advertisement were discussed along with questions for measurement were answered thereby giving the entire Business Analytics Model implementation. © 2017 IEEE.",Business Analytics; Decision Sciences; Operations Management,Artificial intelligence; Customer satisfaction; Marketing; Sales; Business analytics; Customer behaviour; Decision Sciences; Marketing decision; Mobile applications; Model implementation; Operations management; Problem statement; Big data,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,English,"Proc.

Since this is mainly used for the application of robotics, surveillance tracking, human to machine interface, etc. to extract the target status. There are more number of video tracking system to identify the targeted region from the frame of given video. Since the performance of tracking can affect by sudden illumination changes, shadowing effect and uneven background. In moving object detection system, it suffers from dynamic background changing and shadow effect present in the video frames. Due to this, tracking of targeted region may misclassified and results in false detection of moving objects. To rectify this problem there are many techniques to detect and eliminate the shadow from frames like K-Means clustering, Fuzzy C-Means, etc. which are to segment both foreground and background from each frames. Then they remove/suppress shadow region and track the target. Since in that methods, segmentation is based on non-changing background of surveillance area. To rectify this problem, we propose a novel background normalization technique which is based on textural pattern analysis. In texture based system, there are several methods perform texture pattern extraction to verify the feature matching for target region analysis. In this work, we present a novel model of background clustering by using Neighborhood Chain Prediction (NCP) algorithm for uneven background. Here we also propose Differential Boundary Pattern (DBP) to extract texture of the frame for suppressing shadow pixels present in the frame. This is done by estimating lowest intensity present in that frame and predict the area by using DBP method and enhance the pixel to suppress shadow region. From this equalized frame of the given video, we split the frame into several grids. Then from that grid formatted frame, we extract histogram features of the targeted frame and provide classification for each grid in that frame. In that classification can be done by using Machine Learning Classification (MLC) method. This matched grid is consider as the tracked region and provide binary label to separate background and foreground. This type of visual tracking system is robust over sudden illumination changes and dynamic background by using the texture pattern analysis.

Relay coordination in microgrids is complex because of varied fault current magnitude and direction due to existence of Distributed Generation (DG). Over-current relays are feasible and economic choice of protection for distribution systems connected with DG. The coordinated relay settings must account to all possible fault scenarios in both grid connected and isolated microgrid modes of operation. Inadequate fault current levels from grid connected to isolated mode is the major cause of miscoordination in the microgrid network. This paper systematically formulates the relay coordination problem for microgrid scenario as linear interval optimization problem. The feasibility of ILP method in including all the fault scenarios and operating modes of microgrid by representing the variables as intervals are combined to find the optimal overcurrent relay settings. The results show the effectiveness of this method.

Modern Healthcare generates a large amount of diverse data related to patients in digital format. Since modern web applications gives a static view of the patient related data like EHR (Electronic Healthcare Record), PHR (Personal Healthcare Record), EMR (Electronic Medical Record), MRN (Medical Record Number), MHR (Mobilized Health Record) and Electronic Healthcare Predictive Analytics (e-HPA) in US hospitals, which lack in flexibility when multiple medical data are shown at the same time.

Cloud computing is a way or a technique to store, share and access data. It is the most efficient way, it is even cheaper than the conventional way of having physical servers or physical storage devices present at the company premises. It is faster and more efficient. The concept of cloud computing is that there is expandable storage space with no physical storage space which is accessible from anywhere in the world using any device, the data will be available for you. We can access the cloud storage through the internet. The data is stored at the storage units kept around the world managed by data management companies. These companies are responsible for the data the will back it up and it is their job to keep it secure, but even the beat of them have drawbacks. That is what will be addressed here in the paper below, security in cloud computing. Some work has been done on this field it is on that I further build on. Cloud computing is an internet dependent technology, where client data is stored and maintained in the data centers of cloud providers like Google, Amazon, Salesforce.com and Microsoft etc. Limited access to the data could cause various security issues like data leakage, insecure interface, sharing of information. This research paper explains the concept of cloud computing, the various models used in enhancing the security and how can an enhanced security blanket be put around the cloud without increasing the maintenance charges and without making it to complex. I have also put in a new proposal for securing the data in cloud computing. © 2017 IEEE.",Cloud; Cloud computing; Data protection models; Decryption; Encryption; Security,Artificial intelligence; Cloud computing; Clouds; Cryptography; Data privacy; Digital storage; Information management; Security of data; Virtual storage; Cloud providers; Decryption; Efficient schemes; Protection models; Research papers; Security; Security issues; Storage spaces; Big data,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,English,"Proc.

It is highly desired that any BigData management framework must process and analyze data within a fraction of seconds. There are various tools available for this purpose; one of such open source tool is Apache Hadoop. This tool is widely adopted for storage and management of BigData. Several methods have been suggested and implemented to analyze and enhance the Hadoop performance. This paper particularly focuses upon tuning configuration parameter approach. Although there are several configuration parameters which affect the performance of Hadoop, among that MapReduce related parameter has a significant impact. The objective of this work is to enhance the overall performance of Hadoop by reducing job execution time. Reduction in time is obtained by tuning some of MapReduce associated parameters. The right understanding of these parameters is very crucial since varying parameters with improper values can show a negative impact on overall performance. In this paper, proposed approach saves job execution time and optimizes disk usage efficiently.

Most of the crimes get reported and a massive dataset is being generated every year. Analysing the crime reports can help the law enforcement section to take preventive measures for reducing the crime, but processing this voluminous data is strenuous and error-prone. So application of various text mining techniques can be of great help for visualising the crime trend. The present work proposes an effective methodology for analysing crime against women in India. The work involves extracting crime reports from online newspaper articles and the documents consisting crime reports of various states and union territories of India are made to undergo several preprocessing techniques. Each document is treated as bag-of-words and finally an exhaustive list of words have been prepared. Similarity has been measured among the words for selecting relevant features for crime trend analysis. Based on the selected crime features, community detection algorithm has been applied for partitioning the states based on crime against women in India. It is a graph based clustering approach and all the states of India have been considered as nodes of the graph. Each community is a group of states which are similar based on crime trends. The work also gives a new direction of application of the algorithm with certain limitations for incremental datasets where data are being generated regularly. The present methodology compares with some existing feature selection methods and clusters obtained in each method using same algorithm are evaluated which shows that the proposed method is more accurate than the existing methods. © 2017 IEEE.",Community detection; Crime analysis; Feature selection; Graph clustering; Similarity measurement; Text mining,Artificial intelligence; Big data; Clustering algorithms; Crime; Data handling; Data mining; Feature extraction; Graphic methods; Newsprint; Population dynamics; Websites; Community detection; Community detection algorithms; Feature selection methods; Graph clustering; Preprocessing techniques; Similarity measurements; Text mining; Text mining techniques; Computer crime,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,English,"Proc.

Bug tracking results may be employed by the software practitioners of large software projects effectively. The cost of detecting and correcting the defect becomes exponentially higher as we go from requirement analysis to the maintenance phase, where defects might even lead to loss of lives. Software metrics in conjunction with defect data can serve as basis for developing predictive models. Open source projects which encompass contributions from millions of people provide capacious dataset for testing. There have been diverse machine learning techniques proposed in the literature for analyzing complex relationships and extracting useful information from problems using optimal resources and time. However, more extensive research comparing these techniques is needed to establish superiority of one technique over another. This study aims at comparison of 14 ML techniques for development of effective defect prediction models. The issues addressed are 1) Construction of automated tool in Java to collect OO, inheritance and other metrics and detect bugs in classes extracted from open source repository, 2) Use of relevant performance measures to evaluate performance of predictive models to detect bugs in classes, 3) Statistical tests to compare predictive capability of different machine learning techniques, 4) Validation of defect prediction models. The results of the study show that Single Layer Perceptron is the best technique amongst all the techniques used in this study for development of defect prediction models. The conclusions drawn from this study can be used for practical applications by software practitioners to determine best technique for defect prediction and consequently carry out effective allocation of resources. © 2017 IEEE.",Bug prediction; Machine learning; Object-oriented metrics; Open source software; Software reliability,Application programs; Artificial intelligence; Big data; Computer software; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Open source software; Open systems; Program debugging; Software engineering; Software reliability; Statistical tests; Bug predictions; Defect prediction models; Empirical - comparisons; Machine learning techniques; Object oriented metrics; Open source repositories; Predictive capabilities; Single layer perceptron; Object oriented programming,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,English,"Proc.

This is mainly due to the very nature of CNN, that is its ability to work in a similar manner to that of the visual system of the human brain. One of the most exciting application of pattern recognition which is the focal point of the proposed work is face recognition. Despite huge efforts from the researchers spanning several decades, it has remained a substantial challenge due to inter-class and intra-class variabilities. This paper presents two simple, yet effective Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures for facial image recognition. Both the architectures utilize widely adopted filters, Gabor and Frangi for facial image representation. Further, benchmark datasets such as CMU, Grimace, Yale, Face 95 and FIE have been used for testing the efficacy and an accuracy of 952% is obtained. Another aspect of the work proposed is investigating the impact of varying the number and size of feature maps.

A session is a unique identifier generated by a server that is sent to a client for identifying current interaction session, which is stored in a cookie. A cookie is a short text file for identifying a particular client. Since cookies are transmitted over HTTP, they are visible and prone to attacks such as session hijacking. HTTPS is the most widely used mechanism to protect cookies, but utilizing full HTTPS support is not that easy, especially for applications that are highly distributed due to performance and financial issues. Hence, one-time cookies (OTC) are suggested as an alternative for authentication. OTC prevents various attacks, like for example session hijacking, as they are temporarily stored for a particular period of time or only for a particular session.

College of Engineering, Pune, India","Nadi-parikshan, is an important Wrist Pulse based method of diagnosis in the traditional and effective medical system of Ayurveda. Wrist Pulse signals contain some crucial information about the health of a person and hence diagnosis based on Pulse signals has importance. According to the Ayurvedic science, our mind-body constitution or dosha is determined at the time of conception. Thus, we are each born with a distinct combination of the Vatta, Pitta, and Kapha doshas that remains as it is throughout your life. This is known as Prakruti. The balance of all these doshas and the Prakruti play a vital role in the social life. The paper proposes a framework to predict the Pulse after performing Surya Namaskar for people of different Prakruti at different Prahars (Morning, Afternoon or Evening). The identification of Prakruti of a person will be done using a questionnaire. Recording of the Wrist Pulse signals before and after performing Surya Namaskar at different times of the day or Prahar (Morning, Afternoon and Evening) form the dataset. The variations occurring in the Pulse signals shall be determined by processing the signals and these changes will be used as knowledge for our Machine Learning algorithm.

O. S in Electronics and Photonics, Pt. Ravishankar Shukla University, Raipur, India","Communication of the satellite images plays a crucial role in many important applications such as change detection, land cover classification, weather prediction etc. The increase in the demand of satellite images over the band limited channel requires good quality compression tools. Currently, the compression standard developed by Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) is the widely used product for the compression of satellite images. Moreover, one of the important elements which influence the performance of JPEG compression standard is the nature of quantization table. The compression ratio and the decompressed image quality are determined all-together by the quantization table, and hence, the table strongly influences the whole compression performance. The author aims to generate better quantization tables to enhance the compression performance to achieve higher compression ratios while preserving high reconstruction quality for satellite images. A Teaching Learning based Optimization (TLBO) technique is employed to promote higher compression performance for satellite images. The aim is to identify optimal quantization tables that contribute to better compression efficiency in terms of image quality indexes Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean Square Error (MSE). The TLBO based optimization strategy is proposed because it is free from the algorithmic parameters. Experiments were carried out on the three different satellite images. The results demonstrate that the identified optimal quantization tables offer average PSNR gain of about 0.5 dB with the average reduction in MSE of about 10 against the available JPEG quantization table. © 2017 IEEE.",Compression ratio; JPEG; MSE; PSNR; Quantization table; Satellite image compression; TLBO optimization algorithm,Artificial intelligence; Big data; Compression ratio (machinery); Image coding; Image enhancement; Image quality; Mean square error; Optimization; Quantization (signal); Satellites; Signal to noise ratio; Vector quantization; JPEG; Optimization algorithms; PSNR; Quantization tables; Satellite images; Image compression,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,English,"Proc.

This greatly limits the health providers' efforts to improve quality and efficiency. Through this paper, we address this issue on bringing various information from many sources into one place in realtime which can be truly life saving. Also, low ratio of doctor to patient and the low per capita income in India hikes the medical expenses thereby increasing the patient's inaccessibility to receive proper health care in their reach especially for people in the rural areas. A means by which the bridge between the patients and doctors can be gapped and how patients can be treated at a lower expense is the prime concern. This paper focuses on the development of a mobile/web application, through which patients sends their symptomatic query to the doctors through a server. The mobile application will be equipped with first aid instructions, according to the nature and severity of the symptoms, either the patients are directed to respective departments or given emergency help for further treatment. Within the time huge amount of data is collected from users and doctors, this big data will be used to train machines to automate the tasks to some extent. The information gained from analyzing massive amounts of aggregated health data can provide useful insight to improve quality and efficiency for providers and insurers alike. This makes the patients reach out for healthcare solutions easily and cheaply and makes healthcare a easy reach for the unprivileged also.

In low power VLSI designs an adaptive filter can obtain a reduction in terms of area and power consumption. A system with a linear transfer function controlled by variable parameters and a means to adjust those parameters according to an optimization algorithm is called adaptive filter. The Least Mean Square (LMS) filter is one of adaptive filters type which is used commonly, because of its simplicity and also because of its satisfactory convergence performance. The current IIR adaptive filter uses LMS to reduce area-delay product and energy-delay product. To reduce this delay one can implement filter in pipelined structure. Shift-add tree efficiently minimizes the critical path and silicon area without increasing the number of adaptation delays. The structure of IIR adaptive filter designing is done by using two main blocks: IIR block and new coefficients block (weights block). Weights block consists of series of partial product generators and shift/add tree. Partial product generators has 2 to 3 decoders and AND/OR cells. Weights block performs multiply accumulate operations. Filter block depends upon on the new filter coefficients obtaining from weights block.

A flexible solar panel capable of providing 10.2V and 120mA has been used as means of powering up wearable smart cap. The objective is to introduce cost-effective, autonomous and user-friendly device for avoiding pedestrian accidents on roads due to the use of mobile phones as the usage of mobile phones by the pedestrians is a vital concern of safety. There has been immense increase in the number of accidents noticed in the past few years due to the massive use of mobile phones on the roads. The flexible solar panel has been used as the means to power the cap. The flexible solar panel employed in the proposed system has very less weight and is extremely flexible which make it feasible to be installed on the cap. The idea of using a flexible solar panel has the grounds for eliminating the dependency of the proposed smart cap on primary batteries which gets fueled up with time.

However, there are plenty of applications in day to day life, where the choices made by a person may not only depend on his or her earlier preferences, but more on the context. In this work, we incorporate the contextual attributes to cluster the original user-item rating matrix and then apply CF based recommendation algorithms to the clusters independently. It helps to bring down the runtime as we can bypass computations over the entire data and also generate more accurate recommendations as the partitioned clusters hold similar ratings, which produce greater impacts on each other. In order to cluster the rating matrix, we use both centroid based (k-means) and density based (DBSCAN) clustering techniques and finally compare the results. One of the main objectives of our work is to make it more scalable by reducing the runtime without compromising the recommendation quality much.

Deregulation forces the utilities to operate the plant efficiently and economically with reduced in-house auxiliary power consumption. The increase in auxiliary power consumption increases the operation cost of the plant. In future utilities have to correctly predict the power consumption at in-plant auxiliaries to arrive at the total capacity available for selling and to estimate the operational cost. Auxiliary power consumption is an important index that describes how well a thermal power plant is operating. Induced draft (ID) fan power consumption is almost one-third of the total power consumption by in-house auxiliaries. This paper details the methodology adopted for prediction of ID fan power consumption by artificial neural network. Operational parameters from fifty number of boilers have been collected and used for the analysis. Nine influential parameters that accurately describe the power consumption at ID fan are identified. The identified influential parameters are used in the Artificial Neural Network model for predicting the ID fan power consumption. The proposed methodology can be used by power plant operator and designers for effectively predicting the power consumption by ID fan. © 2017 IEEE.,Auxiliary power; Induced draft fan; Power consumption; Prediction; Steam generator,Artificial intelligence; Big data; Cost benefit analysis; Deregulation; Forecasting; Neural networks; Steam generators; Thermoelectric power plants; Artificial neural network modeling; Auxiliary power; Fan power consumption; Induced draft fans; Operational parameters; Power generation markets; Power plant operators; Total power consumption; Electric power utilization,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,English,"Proc.

The importance of building a family tree can be highlighted from its applications ranging from tracing history of hereditary diseases to tracing criminal behavior likelihood in a suspect.

There are several techniques, which can be applied to data sources to extract the patterns that are required. Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is one such mathematical method for data analysis with flourishing popularity across distinct domains, used to find the interesting patterns in binary matrices. Several algorithms were designed for computing patterns in binary matrices, but their computational complexity doesn't fit for large datasets. This Paper addresses a proficient concept analysis algorithm for finding neighbors and constructing a concept lattice using MapReduce framework for a given dense formal contexts of high dimensionality in terms of number of objects by modifying Lindig's upper neighbor algorithm for generating concept lattice. The new MapReduce algorithm namely UNConceptGeneration algorithm is implemented using map and Reduce processes to generate formal concepts to construct the concept lattice. The Map process distributes the dense context across various map tasks and computes the concepts, reduce process aggregates all the generated concepts to produce the final outcome. This paper also addresses how the network delays and data transfer rate overcome during the concept lattice generation, which leads to faster concept analysis. The paper describes Hadoop's fault tolerance which is one of the key features to choose MapReduce to implement this algorithm in a distributed environment.

Nowadays, one of the most serious challenges to solve is to manage water scarcity. As the importance of water usage optimization in monetary point of view is not that pronounced, we lack the incentive to invest in implementing technologically advanced systems for organized distribution of water. This paper describes the development of a meticulous water distribution system at a city level that will guarantee a continuous supply of water, overcoming some major issues like unaccounted supply to entities and Non-Revenue Water (NRW). A centralized control room equipped with a local computing machine and a Human Machine Interface (HMI) to monitor and control the city's water system is proposed. A smart tariff system should be exercised with an IoT-enabled mobile-friendly web portal developed for accessing various water usage statistics accompanied with an option of paying water bills online. In this volumetric, limit based model, the quota assigned to each entity is decided dynamically based on various supply and demand parameters including the availability of water with changing seasons. Adaptive learning through machine learning algorithms was used for the same. Unbilled, unauthorized consumption, apparent losses (water theft and metering inaccuracies) and transportation losses was curbed by monitoring from a remote location via IoT. Higher degree of theft and leakage was concluded using loss detection technique using the differential flow data.

It classifies the text into positive, negative or neutral. Lexicon-based and Supervised Machine Learning-based are the two main approaches in sentiment analysis. Bag-of-words model is used to represent the text as a vector of independent words and machine learning algorithms are used for classification. Polarity shift is the major problem in the Bag-of-words model. Polarity shift is a sentiment classification problem. It can reverse the sentiment polarity of the text. Classification performance of machine learning based systems can get affected by polarity shift. Negation is the type of polarity shift. Negative words can change the polarity of the sentimental words. Polarity shift detection methods are used to detect the polarity shift in the sentences. It helps to improve the performance of machine learning classification algorithms. Natural Language Processing can be used for feature extraction and classification. Sentiment analysis uses Natural Language Processing for extraction of opinion words from the text. Sentiment analysis plays an important role in identifying the opinion of the people about a specific topic or entity. This survey paper reviews the sentiment analysis approaches and highlight the need to address polarity shift problem in sentiment analysis.

Many of these sensory systems are artificially replicated to provide intelligence to the machines. This paper reviews the various techniques and instruments that can be used to design a human olfactory system, which can be used in different applications. The odour detection systems can be broadly classified into four categories such as gas sensors, bio-sensors, gas chromatography systems and hybrid systems. Other common odour detection instruments like electronic noses (E-noses), mass spectrometers (MS), differential optical absorption spectrometers (DOAS) are also reviewed in this paper. The selection of any odour detection technique is influenced by several factors like on-field deployability, odour detection and classification capabilities, sensitivity of the instruments and sensitivity of the instruments to the air matrices. Among all the possible detection methods, Electronic nose is having advanced capabilities as compared to other instruments. The presence of interference noise act as a major hindrance for the efficiency of the odour detection devices. Integration of gas chromatography along with interference filters can provide an increased accuracy in the odour detection. © 2017 IEEE.",Artificial intelligence; Classification; Machine learning; Odour sensors,Artificial intelligence; Audition; Chromatography; Classification (of information); Electromagnetic wave absorption; Electronic equipment; Gas chromatography; Hybrid systems; Learning systems; Light absorption; Spectrometers; Detection device; Detection instruments; Detection methods; Detection sensors; Differential optical absorption spectrometers; Interference filters; Interference noise; Olfactory systems; Electronic nose,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,English,"Proc.

The main purpose of proposed partition clustering approach is to divide the entire area into small clusters and to consider the nodal demand of each vehicle while forming the clusters; then each cluster is solved as vehicle routing problem using ant colony optimization.

But the ACO algorithm has various drawbacks like stagnation, low convergence speed, local optimum problem and long search time (computation time). These problems in ACO can be reduced or eliminated by improving various parameters like pheromone updating factor, pheromone evaporation factor, initial distribution of pheromone value, etc. The search process can be induced by integrating ACO with other algorithms like mutation operators, crossovers of GA (Genetic Algorithm) and PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization), Acoustic factors, ABC (Artificial Bee Colony).

In the modern context, it turns out that some of these definitions of intelligence and the corresponding tests merely measure computational power. Furthermore, in the framework of the original Turing test, for a system to prove itself to be intelligent, a certain amount of deceit is implicitly required which can have serious security implications for future human societies. In this article, we propose a unified framework for developing intelligence tests which takes care of important ethical and practical issues. Our proposed framework has several important consequences. Firstly, it results in the suggestion that it is not possible to construct a single, context independent, intelligence test. Secondly, any measure of intelligence must have access to the process by which a problem is solved by the system under consideration and not merely the final solution. Finally, it requires an intelligent agent to be evolutionary in nature with the flexibility to explore new algorithms on its own. © 2017 Springer-Verlag London Ltd.",Artificial intelligence; Imitation game; Machine ethics; Turing test,Artificial intelligence; Network function virtualization; Network security; Philosophical aspects; Computational power; Context independent; Imitation games; Intelligence tests; Practical issues; Security implications; Turing tests; Unified framework; Testing,Springer London,English,AI Soc.,Article in Press
